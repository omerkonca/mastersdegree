# Important Links Discussed in Class

### 1. Attention is All You Need - Transformers Paper
- [Attention is All You Need - Transformers Makale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- Description: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. This paper introduces the Transformer architecture, which is based solely on attention mechanisms.
